Erlang Computer Systems Management CONSole (or ECSMCons)
Version 1.7

ECSMCons is an Erlang based client/server computer systems 
management console in which a web browser (with websockets
support) is used to manage computer systems.


Features:

Server

Operations that can be performed on the client from the server:

Reboot, shutdown, restart or stop erlang service, ping, wake-on-lan,
when Faronics Deep Freeze is available: freeze, thaw and get status
copy file to client and run command on client.  When the All command
check box is selected, then only the checked workstations will have
that command done on them. Restrict access based on IP address and
username/password (both configurable in ecsmcons.conf).

Client

The client periodically sends messages to the server to indicate
whether the system is "Up" and which user is logged in.  It also
does the command processing sent from the server.


Todo list:

-Get client OS, applications and hardware inventory
-Create better comments/specs for functions
-Change config file (ecsmcons.conf) to use records
-Add configurations for mac and linux


Basic setup

Prerequisites:
1. Erlang (on server and client)
		http://erlang.org
2. YAWS
	  https://github.com/klacke/yaws
	  http://yaws.hyber.org/ 



Client/Server Setup

1. Server Setup
   a. erl file setup

   	  i. ecsmcons.hrl file set up as follow:
         (see ecsmcons-example.hrl in repo)

	  ii. ecom.hrl setup (for deepfreeze and windows 7)
         (see ecom-example.hrl in repo)

	 iii. create ecsmcons.conf
         (see ecsmcons.conf in rep)

   	  iv. compile ecsmcons.erl and ecom.erl, ecomsrv.erl, i.e. erlc ecsmcons.erl and erlc ecom.erl and erlc ecomsrv.erl

   b. create ecsmcons.app  if command line app_start is used see below
     (see ecmscons.app in repo)

   c. run these commands from bash shell:

	  erl -name node@host -pa /path/to/ecsmcons/ebin -r ecomsrv

	  or put ecsmcons ebin in yaws.conf

	  ebin_dir = /path/to/ecsmcons

   d.
	  use browser to access http://localhost:8080
	  
	  use browser to access https://localhost:8443

	  change ports to ports you set up in yaws.conf

   e.

	  in yaws.conf set up appmods for ecsmcons

        appmods = <ecsmcons, ecsmcons>
        appmods = <ecsmcons_ws, ecsmcons_ws>

   f. create /usr/local/var/yaws/www/static and copy ecsmcons/static files there or make soft links to the files

2. Windows setup

   a. copy ecom.beam to something like c:\erl on a windows system (erlang must also be installed on windows system)
   b. set windows system environment variable "Path" to include erlang (location of erl.exe)
   c. install erlang as a service
   	  i. per http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlsrv.html something like this:

	  erlsrv add "0ecom" -name ecom@host -w "C:/erl" -args "-setcookie my_cookie_string -s ecom"

   e. start service
   f. set firewall to allow erl.exe to allow traffic from server IP above

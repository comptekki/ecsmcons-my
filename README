Erlang Computer Systems Management CONSole (or ECSMCons)
Version 1.6

ECSMCons is an Erlang based client/server computer systems 
management console in which a web browser (with websockets
support) is used to manage computer systems.


Features:

Server

Operations that can be performed on the client from the server:

Reboot, shutdown, restart or stop erlang service, ping, wake-on-lan,
when Faronics Deep Freeze is available: freeze, thaw and get status
copy file to client and run command on client.  When the All command
check box is selected, then only the checked workstations will have
that command done on them. Restrict access based on IP address and
username/password (both configurable in ecsmcons.conf).

Client

The client periodically sends messages to the server to indicate
whether the system is "Up" and which user is logged in.  It also
does the command processing sent from the server.


Todo list:

-Get client OS, applications and hardware inventory
-Create better comments/specs for functions
-Change config file (ecsmcons.conf) to use records
-Add configurations for mac and linux


Basic setup

Prerequisites:
1. Erlang (on server and client)
		http://erlang.org
2. Misultin
		https://github.com/ostinelli/misultin


Client/Server Setup

1. Server Setup
   a. erl file setup

   	  i. ecsmcons.hrl file set up as follow:
         (see ecsmcons-example.hrl in repo)

	  ii. ecom.hrl setup (for deepfreeze and windows 7)
         (see ecom-example.hrl in repo)

	 iii. create ecsmcons.conf
         (see ecsmcons.conf in rep)

   	  iv. compile ecsmcons.erl and ecom.erl, ecomsrv.erl, i.e. erlc ecsmcons.erl and erlc ecom.erl and erlc ecomsrv.erl

   b. create ecsmcons.app  if command line app_start is used see below
     (see ecmscons.app in repo)

   c. run these commands from bash shell:

	  erl -name node@host -pa /usr/local/src/misultin/ebin -pa /path/to/ecsmcons/ebin

	  Then in the erlang vm run:

	  ecsmcons:a().

	  This will start misultin on port 8080

	  use browser to access http://localhost:8080
	  
	  or

	  ecsmcons:s().

	  for SSL.  SSL will be attempted if 443 is in the port number.

	  This will start misultin on port 8443

	  use browser to access https://localhost:8443

	  or

	  erl -name node@host -pa /usr/local/src/misultin/ebin -pa /path/to/ecsmcons/ebin

	  then in the erlang VM shell:

	  application:start(ecsmcons) to run as application

	  application:stop(ecsmcons) to stop application

	  or

	  to run on command-line:

	  erl -name node@host -pa /usr/local/src/misultin/ebin -pa /path/to/ecsmcons/ebin -s ecsmcons app_start

2. Windows setup

   a. copy ecom.beam to something like c:\erl on a windows system (erlang must also be installed on windows system)
   b. set windows system environment variable "Path" to include erlang (location of erl.exe)
   c. install erlang as a service
   	  i. per http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlsrv.html something like this:

	  erlsrv add "0ecom" -name ecom@host -w "C:/erl" -args "-setcookie my_cookie_string -s ecom"

   e. start service
   f. set firewall to allow erl.exe to allow traffic from server IP above
